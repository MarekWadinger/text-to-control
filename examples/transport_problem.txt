A distribution company needs to deliver goods from multiple warehouses to several retail stores.
The company wants to minimize the total transportation cost while ensuring that store demands are satisfied and warehouse capacities are not exceeded.

Warehouses:
- W1 located in Bratislava
- W2 located in Košice

Stores:
- S1 in Trnava
- S2 in Nitra
- S3 in Banská Bystrica

Each warehouse has a limited shipping capacity (in tons), but the exact capacities are not specified yet.
Each store has a certain demand (in tons), but the demand for S3 is currently unknown.

The transportation cost per ton between each warehouse and store is as follows (in €):

| From | To | Cost €/ton |
|------|----|-------------|
| W1 | S1 | 14 |
| W1 | S2 | 10 |
| W1 | S3 | 18 |
| W2 | S1 | 12 |
| W2 | S2 | 9 |
| W2 | S3 | 11 |

Objective:
Minimize total transportation cost while meeting all store demands and not exceeding warehouse capacities.

Constraints:
- Each store must receive its total demand from any combination of warehouses.
- The total amount shipped from each warehouse cannot exceed its available capacity.
- Negative shipments are not allowed.

Decision variables:
- \( x_{ij} \): tons shipped from warehouse \( i \) to store \( j \).

Additional note:
The company mentioned that there might be a maximum shipping distance limit (in km), but this limit has not been defined yet.

# NOTE: The following data were provided as clarifications earlier.
# These lines are comments and will be ignored by the Expert Agent.

The maximum shipping capacity for each warehouse is:
- W1: 800 tons
- W2: 700 tons

The demand for each store is:
- S1: 400 tons
- S2: 500 tons
- S3: 600 tons

There is no maximum shipping distance limit, but the distances are:
- W1 to S1: 100 km
- W1 to S2: 150 km
- W1 to S3: 200 km
- W2 to S1: 120 km
- W2 to S2: 100 km
- W2 to S3: 180 km
