Company Record’m Record have three studios in which CD’s are made. Cost of manufacturing
CD in first studio is 10x, where x is number of CD’s made. In second studio the cost is 2y^2 and
in third cost of manufacturing CD’s is defined as z^2 + 8z. Note, that y, z are numbers of CD
made in respective studios. Objective is to minimize cost of production. Company wants to
produce exactly 100 CDs. Unions pose additional constraints, that workers in studios 2 and 3
must not work more than 60 hours altogether. Consider that time to produce CD in studio 2 is
4h and in studio 3 is 2h.
