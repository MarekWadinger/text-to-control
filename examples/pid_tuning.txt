We want to tune a PID controller for a SISO plant to track a unit step with minimal error and limited control effort.

Plant (continuous-time):
G(s) = 1 / (s (s + 1))

Controller:
C(s) = Kp + Ki/s + Kd s

Decision variables:
Kp ≥ 0, Ki ≥ 0, Kd ≥ 0  (bounds not yet specified)

Performance objective (to minimize):
J = ∫_0^T [ w_e * |e(t)| + w_u * u(t)^2 ] dt
where e(t) is tracking error, u(t) is control signal, and T is the evaluation horizon.

Constraints (desired but not fully specified):
- Maximum overshoot of the output ≤ M% (percent)
- Settling time Ts ≤ S seconds (2% criterion)
- Control effort bound |u(t)| ≤ Umax
- Closed-loop stability (all poles in LHP)

Notes:
- Use a unit step reference r(t) = 1.
- Sampling time or simulation step not specified (can be continuous simulation).
- We didn't specify weights (w_e, w_u), horizon T, or numeric limits (M, S, Umax).

Goal:
Find Kp, Ki, Kd to minimize J subject to the constraints above.
