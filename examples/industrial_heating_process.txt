A thermal control engineer is designing a temperature control system for an industrial heating process.
The goal is to automatically maintain the desired temperature in a large furnace using a PID controller,
so that the temperature reaches the target value quickly, without overshooting or oscillations,
and remains stable during operation.

System description:

The heating system can be modeled by the transfer function:
G(s) = 1 / (s² + 3s + 2)
where the input is the heater power and the output is the furnace temperature.

The PID controller adjusts the heater power according to the difference between
the desired and actual temperature:
C(s) = Kp + Ki/s + Kd·s

Available parameters to tune:

Kp — proportional gain (determines how strongly the controller reacts to error)

Ki — integral gain (eliminates steady-state error)

Kd — derivative gain (improves response speed and stability)

Performance goal:

The objective is to minimize the total temperature error over time,
measured using the Integral of Absolute Error (IAE) or
the Integral of Time-weighted Absolute Error (ITAE).

The system should quickly reach the desired temperature and remain stable with minimal oscillations.

Constraints:

All controller parameters must be non-negative (Kp, Ki, Kd ≥ 0).

The closed-loop system must remain stable (no sustained oscillations or divergence).

The temperature overshoot must not exceed 10% of the setpoint.

The settling time (time to reach steady state) must be less than 5 seconds.

Objective:

Find the optimal values of Kp, Ki, and Kd that minimize the total temperature control error,
while ensuring the furnace temperature response is stable, fast, and accurate.

Expected results:

Optimal controller gains: Kp*, Ki*, Kd*

Minimum error value (IAE or ITAE)

Step response of the furnace temperature showing minimal overshoot and fast stabilization

Confirmation of closed-loop stability (phase and gain margins)
